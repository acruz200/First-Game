Scipts from Tutorial 

You move with WASD and shoot with left click mouse button

I added some watermelons as targets and for my planes i added gradient images that i created using gimp online tools

I add a traffic light, street light, and some trees around the city to give it more life 

Player wins if all 5 targets are destroyed
